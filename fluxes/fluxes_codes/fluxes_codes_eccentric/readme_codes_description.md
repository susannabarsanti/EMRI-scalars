**eccentric_scalar.m**

Code for the scalar eccentric scalar flux computation. 
Parameters to check: 
- m_max: set to 25
- m_thr: set to 6. It was originally 2, but it was too low. 

**eccentric_tensorial.m**

Code for the gravitational eccentric scalar flux computation. 
Parameters to check: 
- m_max: set to 25. For some points down to 21 becuase of "kernel time-out"
- m_thr: set to 6. It was originally 2, but it was too low.
