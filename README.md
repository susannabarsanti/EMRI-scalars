# EMRI-scalars 
Mathematica codes for EMRIs with scalar fields. Single codes for the computations of massless scalar and gravitational fluxes for:  
1) equatorial circular orbits;
2) equatorial eccentric orbits;
3) circular inclined orbits.
   
It also provides the code for massive scalar fields for equatorial circular orbits. The fluxes computed with such codes are collected into repositories here. 
Finally, three EMRI_Inspiral_Evolution codes are present here. 1) EMRI evolution for equatoria circular orbits, GW analytic quadrupolar template (AK) adjusted with the fully numerical inspiral, computations of the faithfulness, snr and fisher matrices with such waveforms. 2) as 1, for equatorial eccentric orbtis,  3) as 1&2 for circular inclined orbits. The GW templates here are the Numerical Kludge (NK)  4) as 1 for massive scalars.
